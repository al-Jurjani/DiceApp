# Flutter Dice Roller App

This is a simple mobile app built with Flutter that simulates rolling a pair of dice. Tapping either of the dice on the screen will "roll" both of them, generating new random faces.

## About This Project

This application was developed as a hands-on learning exercise while taking the **"Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide"** course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy. This project was key to understanding how to manage and update the state of widgets in response to user input.

You can find the course here: [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)

## Core Concepts Practiced

This project focuses heavily on the fundamentals of state management and user interaction in Flutter:

-   **Stateful Widgets**: Using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` to update the UI when the dice values change.
-   **Asset Management**: Including and loading image assets (`dice1.png`, `dice2.png`, etc.) using the `pubspec.yaml` file.
-   **User Input**: Making the dice images tappable and responsive to user actions.
-   **Random Number Generation**: Using Dart's `Random` class to simulate the dice rolls.
-   **Basic Layout**: Structuring the UI with `Row`, `Expanded`, and `Center` to create a responsive layout.

## Key Points

- Primarily the 'main.dart' and 'my_container.dart' files are used.
- All the other files were used to learning and testing.
