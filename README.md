# Dice App

A simple dice application. My very first Flutter app!
Six separate images represent each side of a dice. Tapping a button will roll the dice, and randomly change to one of the six sides.
In the process, the background colour will also change.

## Key Points

- Primarily the 'main.dart' and 'my_container.dart' files are used.
- All the other files were used to learning and testing.
- The course I am following: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps
